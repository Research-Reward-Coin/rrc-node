# The scientist have to be aware of a contraint regarding using the volumes.

# The scope is the request reproducibility challenge.
# Here it is for replicable.
# The contract is for confirming that the container is producing the same
# outputs when ran with the same inputs.
# The output here is the id of the contract that we are replicating.
# You should change this by looking for the contract id in the block you want to
# replicate: rrc block will give you the last block.
